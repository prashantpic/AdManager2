    deactivate thirdpartyconnectivityservice014

    loop 4. Zap Triggered: Execute Zap Logic (Filter, Format, Map Data)
        note over ExternalZapierGoogleAdsIntegration: Zapier's internal engine processes the incoming data according to the Zap's configuration. This includes data transformation and mapping for the Google Ads action.

    note over Merchant, ExternalAdNetworkGoogleAdsAPI: Data Mapping & Protocol Transformation: Handled by the Zapier platform based on merchant's Zap configuration. Ad Manager provides data via webhook/API; Zapier consumes it, maps it, and calls Google Ads API in its required format.
    note over Merchant, ExternalAdNetworkGoogleAdsAPI: Synchronization: This flow shows Zapier-driven actions. Ad Manager's AdNetworkIntegrationService may perform separate, periodic background syncs with Google Ads to ensure overall data consistency, independently of this Zapier flow.
    note over Merchant, ExternalAdNetworkGoogleAdsAPI: Retry Policies & Circuit Breakers: Zapier has built-in retry mechanisms for its steps, including calls to Google Ads API. If ThirdPartyConnectivityService calls Zapier webhooks, it should implement its own retries for transient failures.
    note over Merchant, ExternalAdNetworkGoogleAdsAPI: Idempotency: Webhook endpoints on Zapier and API endpoints on ThirdPartyConnectivityService (if called by Zapier) should ideally be idempotent. Google Ads API operations called by Zapier should also consider idempotency.
