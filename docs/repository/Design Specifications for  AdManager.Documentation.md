# Software Design Specification: AdManager.Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides the Software Design Specification (SDS) for the `AdManager.Documentation` repository. This repository serves as the central knowledge base for the Ad Manager Platform, hosting all user, technical, administrative, and training documentation. The documentation will be built and published using Docusaurus.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this SDS is limited to the setup, configuration, content structure, and initial content guidelines for the `AdManager.Documentation` Docusaurus site. It covers the files and directories defined in the repository's `file_structure_json`.

### 1.3 Overview of the Documentation Portal
The Ad Manager Documentation Portal aims to provide comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date information for all user roles associated with the Ad Manager Platform. This includes merchants (Merchant Admins, Campaign Managers), internal support staff, platform administrators, and developers. The portal will be a static website generated by Docusaurus, featuring organized content, search functionality, and versioning capabilities (if implemented later).

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Technology Stack
*   **Static Site Generator**: Docusaurus v3.1.1
*   **Runtime Environment**: Node.js v20.11.1 LTS (for Docusaurus build and development)
*   **Templating/Customization**: React v18.2.0 (used by Docusaurus for theming and components)
*   **Content Language**: Markdown (primarily), MDX (Markdown + JSX)
*   **Diagramming**: Mermaid.js (for embedding diagrams in Markdown)
*   **Version Control**: Git

### 2.2 Key Features
*   **Static Site Generation**: Fast, secure, and easily deployable documentation.
*   **Docs-as-Code**: Documentation managed in Markdown, versioned with Git.
*   **Organized Content**: Structured navigation via sidebars and categories.
*   **Search Functionality**: Built-in or plugin-based search (e.g., `docusaurus-plugin-search-local`).
*   **Theming and Customization**: Ability to apply Ad Manager branding.
*   **Multi-Section Documentation**: Separate areas for User Guides, Technical Docs, Admin Docs, and Training.
*   **Versioning**: (Future consideration) Docusaurus supports documentation versioning.
*   **SEO Friendly**: Docusaurus provides features for SEO optimization.

## 3. Design Considerations

### 3.1 Information Architecture
The information architecture will be primarily defined by the `sidebars.js` file and the directory structure within `docs/`. Content will be organized into logical sections catering to different audiences and topics:
*   **Introduction (`docs/intro.md`)**: General welcome and overview.
*   **User Guides (`docs/user-guides/`)**: For merchants using the platform.
*   **Technical Documentation (`docs/technical/`)**: For developers and architects.
*   **Administrative Documentation (`docs/administrative/`)**: For platform administrators.
*   **Training Materials (`docs/training/`)**: For structured learning paths.
*   **Glossary (`docs/glossary.md`)**: Centralized definitions.

### 3.2 Content Strategy
*   **Target Audiences**: Merchant Admins, Campaign Managers, Platform Administrators, Developers, Support Staff.
*   **Content Types**:
    *   Conceptual explanations.
    *   Step-by-step tutorials and how-to guides.
    *   API specifications (links or embedded).
    *   System architecture diagrams.
    *   Data models.
    *   FAQs.
    *   Operational runbooks.
    *   Training modules.
*   **Tone and Voice**: Clear, concise, professional, and user-centric. Technical jargon will be explained or linked to the glossary.
*   **Visuals**: Screenshots for UI guides, Mermaid diagrams for technical concepts.

### 3.3 SEO for Documentation
Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box support for SEO, including:
*   Customizable meta tags (title, description) per page via Markdown frontmatter.
*   SEO-friendly URLs generated from file names/slugs.
*   Sitemap generation.
These features will be utilized to enhance discoverability.

### 3.4 Branding and Theming
*   The Ad Manager Platform logo (`static/img/logo.png`) will be used in the navbar and footer.
*   Custom styles will be applied via `src/css/custom.css` to align with Ad Manager branding guidelines (colors, fonts, etc.).

### 3.5 Accessibility
The documentation portal will strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, leveraging Docusaurus's accessibility features and careful content creation practices.

    javascript
    // sidebars.js
    module.exports = {
      userGuideSidebar: [
        { type: 'doc', id: 'user-guides/index', label: 'Overview' },
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Getting Started',
          items: [/* 'user-guides/getting-started/account-setup', etc. */],
        },
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Campaign Management',
          items: ['user-guides/campaign-management/creating-campaigns' /*, other campaign docs */],
        },
        // ... other user guide categories (Product Catalogs, Promotions, Analytics, A/B Testing, etc.)
        { type: 'doc', id: 'user-guides/faq', label: 'FAQ' },
      ],
      technicalDocSidebar: [
        { type: 'doc', id: 'technical/index', label: 'Overview' },
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Architecture',
          items: ['technical/architecture/system-overview' /*, other architecture docs */],
        },
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'API Specifications',
          items: ['technical/api-specifications/index' /*, links or pages for specific APIs */],
        },
        // ... other technical doc categories (Data Models, Deployment, Operations, Security Design)
      ],
      adminDocSidebar: [
        { type: 'doc', id: 'administrative/index', label: 'Overview' },
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Platform Management',
          items: ['administrative/platform-management/system-configuration' /*, Health Monitoring, User & Role Mgmt, etc. */],
        },
        // ... other admin doc categories (Billing Config, Maintenance)
      ],
      trainingSidebar: [
        { type: 'doc', id: 'training/index', label: 'Overview' },
        {
          type: 'category',
          label: 'Merchant Admin Training',
          items: ['training/merchant-admin-training/module-1-platform-overview' /*, other modules */],
        },
        // ... other training categories for different roles
      ],
      // A global sidebar could also be used if structure is simpler, but multiple sidebars allow for focused navigation.
      // For a single combined sidebar:
      // mainSidebar: [
      //  'intro',
      //  { type: 'doc', id: 'glossary', label: 'Glossary'},
      //  { type: 'category', label: 'User Guides', items: [ { type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'user-guides' } ]},
      //  { type: 'category', label: 'Technical Documentation', items: [ { type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'technical' } ]},
      //  { type: 'category', label: 'Administrative Documentation', items: [ { type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'administrative' } ]},
      //  { type: 'category', label: 'Training Materials', items: [ { type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'training' } ]},
      // ],
    };
    
    *Note: The example above uses multiple named sidebars. If a single, unified sidebar is preferred, a structure like `mainSidebar` using `autogenerated` or explicit listing would be used, and `docusaurus.config.js` navbar items would point to `doc` type with `docId` to specific pages within that single sidebar structure.* The file structure given seems to imply separate categories, so multiple sidebars or a well-structured single sidebar is appropriate. For this SDS, we will assume distinct logical sections manageable through `sidebars.js`. The `sidebarId` in `docusaurus.config.js` should match the keys in `sidebars.js`.

    *   Technical Docs: Precise, detailed, objective.
    *   Admin Docs: Clear, procedural, authoritative.
*   **Updates (REQ-SUD-007)**: Documentation will be treated as code. Changes to the platform features will require corresponding updates to the documentation. A process should be established:
    *   Documentation updates are part of feature development/bug fix lifecycle.
    *   Pull requests for documentation changes.
    *   Regular review cycles for outdated content.
    *   Consider versioning documentation alongside major platform releases.

## 5. Deployment and Maintenance

### 5.1 Build Process
The documentation site will be built using the command `npm run build` or `yarn build`, which invokes `docusaurus build`. This generates a static `build` directory.

### 5.2 Deployment Strategy
*   The static site generated in the `build` directory will be deployed to a hosting service (e.g., AWS S3 + CloudFront, AWS Amplify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify). The specific choice will align with the overall platform's hosting strategy.
*   Deployment should be automated as part of a CI/CD pipeline, triggered on commits to the main branch of the documentation repository.

### 5.3 Documentation Update Lifecycle
1.  **Identify Need**: New feature, feature change, user feedback, outdated content.
2.  **Draft Content**: Create or modify Markdown files.
3.  **Review**: Peer review for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Technical review for technical docs.
4.  **Commit & Push**: Changes pushed to Git repository.
5.  **CI/CD Trigger**: Automated build and deployment of the updated documentation site.
6.  **Verification**: Check the live documentation site for correct rendering and content.
7.  **Periodic Review**: Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of all documentation sections to ensure ongoing accuracy and relevance (as per REQ-SUD-007).

## 6. Non-functional Requirements Impact

*   **Usability (REQ-SUD-001, 3.2.5)**:
    *   Clear information architecture defined in `sidebars.js`.
    *   Effective search functionality.
    *   Comprehensive and easy-to-understand content.
    *   Contextual help principles (though not directly implemented in Docusaurus core, content can link contextually).
*   **Maintainability (REQ-SUD-007)**:
    *   Docs-as-code approach using Markdown and Git.
    *   Modular content structure.
    *   Automated build and deployment.
    *   Clear processes for updates and reviews.
*   **Accessibility**:
    *   Leverage Docusaurus's built-in accessibility features.
    *   Follow content accessibility best practices (e.g., alt text for images, proper heading structures).

This SDS provides the blueprint for creating a comprehensive, maintainable, and user-friendly documentation portal for the Ad Manager Platform.
