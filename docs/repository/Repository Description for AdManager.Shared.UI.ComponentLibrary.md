# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
AdManager.Shared.UI.ComponentLibrary


---

# 2. Description
This repository contains the shared UI component library for the Ad Manager Platform, built upon a base framework like Material-UI or Ant Design. It provides a comprehensive set of reusable React components, such as buttons, forms, tables, modals, charts, navigation elements, and layout primitives, all styled according to the Ad Manager's design system and branding guidelines. The primary goal is to ensure visual and interactive consistency across all merchant-facing, admin-facing, and affiliate-facing user interfaces. All components are developed with accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance - REQ-6-011) and internationalization (i18n) support in mind. This library also includes theming capabilities, shared utility functions for UI logic, and potentially Storybook for component development and documentation. It is consumed as a dependency by all frontend application repositories (e.g., Merchant Portal Shell, Admin Portal, Affiliate Portal) to accelerate development, maintain high UI quality, and simplify future design updates by providing a single source of truth for UI elements. It acts as a foundational piece for the presentation layer of the Ad Manager platform.
