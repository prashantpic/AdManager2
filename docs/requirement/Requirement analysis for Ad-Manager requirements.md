                    *   Ad set configuration (targeting, bidding strategies, budget allocation).
                    *   Creative management (uploading, associating with ads).
                    *   Retrieval of comprehensive performance metrics (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, ROAS, CPA, etc.).
                    *   Audience synchronization (e.g., custom audiences, lookalike audiences).
                    *   Product catalog feed submission and synchronization.
                *   Robust error handling, retry mechanisms (e.g., exponential backoff with jitter), and circuit breaker patterns will be implemented for these integrations.
            *   **Payment Gateway Integrations:**
                *   Support for multiple payment methods (e.g., Mada, STC Pay, PayPal, credit/debit cards) for merchant subscriptions and potentially ad spend if managed through the platform.
                *   Ensures smooth checkouts, critical for converting ad-driven sales if the platform handles transactions directly or for subscription billing.
            *   **Shipping Integrations:**
                *   Connect with multiple shipping providers (local and international).
                *   Allow merchants to set shipping rules and calculate costs automatically.
                *   Enhances customer trust and supports ad campaigns with reliable fulfillment information.
            *   **Zapier Integration:**
                *   Integration with Google Ads via Zapier (e.g., using a valid integration path such as `https://zapier.com/apps/google-ads/integrations/[PlatformZapierAppIdentifier]` or a general path like `https://zapier.com/apps/google-ads/integrations` once the specific integration is established) to allow automation of lead management and campaign performance tracking, enhancing advertising efficiency.

        **3.3.2.3 App Store Integration Framework**
            *   The `[PlatformName]` App Store (e.g., accessible via a valid URL such as `https://apps.[ActualPlatformDomain].sa/en` once defined and configured) will allow third-party apps to extend Ad Manager functionality.
            *   An integration framework for these apps will be defined, including:
                *   API specifications (e.g., RESTful or GraphQL).
                *   Secure authentication and authorization methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, specifying grant types like Authorization Code Grant with PKCE).
                *   Webhook systems for event-driven communication.
                *   Potentially an SDK for third-party developers (e.g., in TypeScript/JavaScript).
                *   Clear API versioning and lifecycle management policies.
            *   This enables integration of specialized ad tools (e.g., WhatsApp for automated marketing) to enhance campaign performance.

**3.4 Data Requirements**

    **3.4.1 Data Model**
        *   **Relational Data (Amazon RDS - PostgreSQL):**
            *   Conceptual data models (e.g., Entity-Relationship Diagrams - ERDs) must be defined, documented, and maintained for structured data. An ORM like TypeORM is recommended for use with NestJS.
            *   Entities include: User Accounts, Merchant Profiles, Ad Campaigns (metadata: ID, name, budget, schedule, status, ad network specific IDs), Affiliate Programs, Discount Codes, Orders (linked from core platform), Subscription Plans, Billing Information, AuditLogs (for critical system and user actions), ProductCatalogOverrides.
            *   Database schema changes will be managed via a migration tool (e.g., TypeORM migrations, Flyway, Liquibase).
        *   **Document Data (Amazon DynamoDB):**
            *   Detailed document structures must be defined, documented, and maintained for semi-structured and high-velocity data. Careful design of primary keys, GSIs, and LSIs is crucial.
            *   Entities include: Ad Configurations (targeting parameters, creative associations), Campaign Performance Logs (impressions, clicks, conversions per time unit, per ad network), User Activity Logs, Product Catalog Feeds (raw and processed versions, Ad Manager specific overrides/customizations), User Preferences for the Ad Manager, A/BTestResults (detailed logs and outcomes).
            *   DynamoDB Streams can be used with AWS Lambda for real-time data processing.
        *   **Data Linkage:** Clear strategies for linking related data across RDS and DynamoDB will be established and documented (e.g., campaign metadata in RDS linked to performance logs in DynamoDB via Campaign ID).
        *   **Data Dictionary:** A comprehensive data dictionary must be created and maintained, detailing each data entity, attribute (name, data type, length, constraints, description), relationships, and business meaning.
        *   **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):** Data flow diagrams illustrating data movement between system components, external integrations (ad networks, payment gateways), and data stores must be developed and maintained. This should cover data ingestion (e.g., from `[PlatformName]`, ad networks), processing, storage, and egress (e.g., to reporting dashboards, ad networks).

    **3.4.2 Data Validation**
        *   Input validation will be implemented at API endpoints (leveraging NestJS pipes and class-validator) and at the data ingestion layer.
        *   Business-specific data validation rules will be enforced, including but not limited to:
            *   Campaign end date must be after start date.
            *   Budget allocations must be positive values.
            *   Product catalog feeds must adhere to the specifications of target ad networks.
            *   Business Rule: Validation of product catalog feeds against ad network specifications must occur prior to submission, with clear error reporting to the merchant for correction.
            *   Discount codes must be unique (within a merchant's scope) and may follow a defined pattern.
            *   Offer conditions (e.g., minimum purchase for BOGO) must be logically sound.
        *   Email validation mechanisms will be used for user-provided email addresses.
        *   **Data Quality Metrics:** Key data quality metrics (e.g., completeness, accuracy, timeliness, consistency, uniqueness) must be defined for critical data elements (e.g., campaign performance data, product catalog data, merchant PII). Processes for monitoring these metrics and reporting on data quality issues must be established.

    **3.4.3 Data Retention**
        *   Clear data retention policies will be established for different categories of data, considering business needs, storage costs (leveraging S3 lifecycle policies for archiving to S3 Glacier/Glacier Deep Archive), and legal/compliance obligations. Examples:
            *   Detailed campaign performance logs: Retain for [e.g., 2 years], then aggregate or anonymize.
            *   User activity logs: Retain for [e.g., 1 year].
            *   Archived/inactive product catalogs: Retain for [e.g., 6 months] after deactivation.
            *   PII associated with closed merchant accounts: Anonymize or delete after [e.g., 30 days] unless legally required otherwise.
            *   Anonymized performance data older than [e.g., 5 years] will be purged.
        *   **Data Archival and Purging:** Define and document procedures for data archival (e.g., to S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long-term, low-cost storage) and secure data purging in compliance with retention policies and legal requirements. This includes audit trails for archival and purging activities.

    **3.4.4 Product Data Management**
        *   The Ad Manager must be able to ingest product information for creating Product Catalogs.
        *   Product data synchronized from the `[PlatformName]` e-commerce platform's product database serves as the base data for Ad Manager catalogs. This synchronization process must be robust and handle updates efficiently.
        *   Supported methods for product data ingestion and management will include:
            *   Direct integration with the `[PlatformName]` e-commerce platform's product database for synchronization of base product data.
            *   Bulk import via standard file formats (e.g., CSV, XML) for initial ingestion or updates to the base product data if direct sync is not fully comprehensive for all merchant needs. This process must include validation and error reporting.
            *   Manual entry and editing of product details *within the Ad Manager*. These Ad Manager-specific customizations, overrides (e.g., ad-specific titles, descriptions, images), or additions for products not yet in the core platform (e.g., for testing) will be stored as a separate layer or clearly marked as distinct from the synchronized base data.
        *   A conflict resolution strategy must be defined for instances where base product data changes in `[PlatformName]` for products that also have Ad Manager-specific overrides. This strategy should address how to handle such conflicts (e.g., notify the merchant, preserve Ad Manager overrides by default, offer a merge/review interface, or automatically re-apply overrides if applicable).
        *   **Data Migration (If Applicable for Product Data):**
            *   If merchants have existing ad campaign data or product catalog customizations outside `[PlatformName]` that need to be imported into the Ad Manager, a data migration strategy must be developed.
            *   This strategy shall cover:
                *   Source data identification, profiling, and analysis.
                *   Data mapping from source systems to Ad Manager data models, documented in mapping specifications.
                *   Data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment rules.
                *   Migration tools and processes (e.g., scripts, ETL jobs), including scheduling and execution plans.
                *   Validation and reconciliation procedures post-migration to ensure data integrity and completeness.
                *   Rollback plan for migration in case of failure.
                *   Communication plan for merchants regarding the migration process.

    **3.4.5 Data Privacy and Protection**
        *   **Data Classification:** All data stored and processed by the Ad Manager must be classified based on sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted/PII). Access controls and protection mechanisms must align with this classification.
        *   **PII Handling:** Specific procedures for handling PII must be documented and implemented, including purpose limitation for collection, secure storage, authorized processing, strict access control (least privilege), and timely, secure disposal, in line with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations.
        *   **Data Subject Rights (DSR):** The system must support processes for data subject rights requests (e.g., access, rectification, erasure/anonymization, portability, restriction of processing, objection) as mandated by GDPR/CCPA. This includes identifying, retrieving, and acting upon relevant merchant and potentially end-customer data (if applicable through ad interactions and stored by the platform) within statutory timeframes.
        *   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Where feasible and appropriate (e.g., for analytics, testing, development), PII should be anonymized or pseudonymized. Techniques used and their effectiveness in preventing re-identification must be documented.
        *   **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):** Ensure DPAs are in place with all third-party ad networks and other sub-processors where merchant or customer PII is shared or processed.
        *   **Privacy by Design and by Default:** Privacy considerations must be integrated into the system design and development lifecycle.
        *   Business Rule: Default privacy settings for new features or data collection points will be the most privacy-protective option (Privacy by Default).

**3.5 Business Features (Supporting Overall Store Management)**
These features, while part of the broader `[PlatformName]` platform, have indirect relevance to advertising success.
*   **Multiple Subscription Plans:**
    *   Offer Basic, Pro, and Plus plans with varying features and limits.
    *   The Basic plan may be free or low-cost with limited functionality.

    *   Includes apps for marketing automation, customer engagement, etc.
    *   Enables integration of specialized tools that can complement advertising efforts.

**4. System Architecture and Technical Stack**

**4.1 Architectural Approach**
*   The system will be developed with a modular architecture, leveraging NestJS modules for clean separation of concerns (e.g., AdCampaignModule, AnalyticsModule, UserModule, IntegrationModule).
*   The system will be designed following an API-first approach, ensuring that all functionalities are accessible via well-defined APIs, facilitating frontend development, integrations, and future extensions.
*   The architecture aims to avoid being a monolithic application while also avoiding overly granular microservices. Functionalities may be grouped into logical service boundaries ("repositories" of functionality) that can be developed and potentially deployed with a degree of isolation.
*   **Inter-module/Inter-service Communication:**
    *   Within a modular monolith, communication will primarily be through direct method calls and dependency injection as facilitated by NestJS.
    *   If modules evolve into independently deployable services, communication will utilize:
        *   Synchronous: REST APIs via Amazon API Gateway. gRPC can be considered for high-performance internal communication if a microservices architecture is adopted.
        *   Asynchronous: Event-driven communication using AWS SQS/SNS.

**4.2 Backend Technology Stack**

    **4.2.1 Framework**

    **4.2.3 Compute**
        *   **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Virtual servers for hosting the NestJS application, potentially within containers managed by ECS or for specific workloads not suited for Fargate. AWS Application Load Balancers (ALB) will be used in front of EC2 instances.
        *   **AWS Lambda:** Serverless computing for handling asynchronous tasks, processing ad impressions, generating performance reports, or triggering notifications. AWS Lambda Powertools (TypeScript) should be used for best practices in logging, metrics, and tracing.
        *   **AWS Fargate:** Recommended for serverless container execution with AWS ECS, reducing operational overhead for managing EC2 instances for containerized applications.

    **4.2.4 API Management**
        *   **Amazon API Gateway:** Manages and exposes RESTful APIs for the Ad Manager platform, enabling secure communication with frontends and third-party ad networks. Supports rate limiting, authentication (JWT), and integration with AWS Lambda for serverless endpoints. Must be protected by AWS WAF.

    **4.2.5 Database**
        *   **Relational - Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL):** A managed relational database service for storing structured data. Connection pooling must be implemented. Regular automated backups and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) are mandatory. Read replicas should be considered for scaling read-heavy workloads.
        *   **Document DB - Amazon DynamoDB:** A NoSQL document database for semi-structured data. Requires careful design of primary keys and indexes (GSIs/LSIs). On-demand capacity or provisioned capacity with auto-scaling should be used. DynamoDB Streams with Lambda for real-time processing.

    **4.2.6 Caching**
        *   **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis):** A managed in-memory caching service for storing frequently accessed data (active ad campaign details, user session data, computed metrics, database query results, API responses). Configure appropriate eviction policies and ensure encryption in transit and at rest.

    **4.2.7 Message Queues**
        *   **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service):** A managed message queue service for handling asynchronous tasks. Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) must be configured for error handling. Set appropriate visibility timeouts.

    **4.2.8 Storage**
        *   **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** A scalable object storage service for storing ad assets and campaign-related files. Must use server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). Lifecycle policies for transitioning data to S3 Glacier for cost optimization. Versioning for critical assets. Secure with bucket policies and IAM. AWS CloudFront for content delivery.

    **4.2.9 Authentication**
        *   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Secures API endpoints. Implemented using `@nestjs/jwt` module, strong signing algorithms (e.g., RS256), short-lived access tokens, refresh token strategy, and secure HttpOnly cookie storage for tokens on the client-side.

*   **Internationalization:** `react-i18next` or `FormatJS (react-intl)`.
*   **Testing:** Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests. Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
*   **Hosting:** See section 3.3.1 for detailed hosting requirements using AWS S3/CloudFront, AWS Amplify, or ECS/Fargate for SSR/SSG applications.

**4.4 Deployment and Infrastructure**

    **4.4.1 Containerization and Orchestration**
        *   **Containerization:** Docker will be used to containerize the NestJS application(s). Multi-stage builds for optimized and secure images. Images will be scanned for vulnerabilities (e.g., AWS ECR scanning, Trivy).
        *   **Orchestration:** AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) with AWS Fargate is the recommended approach for managing, scaling, and deploying containerized applications to minimize operational overhead. AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) can be considered if existing Kubernetes expertise or specific K8s features are required.

    **4.4.2 Configuration Management**
        *   Application configurations and secrets (database credentials, API keys, third-party service configurations) across different environments will be managed securely using AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data (with rotation capabilities) and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for other configuration parameters.

    **4.4.3 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
        *   All AWS infrastructure will be provisioned and managed using IaC principles. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) with TypeScript is recommended, aligning with the backend stack. Alternatives include Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.

**4.5 Implementation Notes (Adapted from Original)**
*   **Scalability:** Utilize AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances (if used directly), ECS service auto-scaling with Fargate, and AWS Lambda for serverless tasks to optimize costs and handle traffic spikes.
*   **Security:** Implement AWS IAM roles and policies following the principle of least privilege for all AWS resources. Utilize AWS WAF with managed and custom rule sets for all public-facing API Gateway endpoints and CloudFront distributions. Employ AWS KMS for managing encryption keys for data at rest (S3, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache).
*   **Integration with Ad Networks:** Utilize Amazon API Gateway to interface with external ad platforms via RESTful APIs, potentially leveraging AWS Lambda for processing callbacks and asynchronous integration tasks.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Continuously monitor resource usage with Amazon CloudWatch to optimize allocation. Favor serverless options like Lambda, SQS, and Fargate where appropriate. Implement S3 lifecycle policies and choose appropriate DynamoDB/RDS capacity modes (on-demand vs. provisioned with auto-scaling).

**5. Operational Requirements**

*   **Amazon CloudWatch:**
    *   Monitor application performance, track key business and operational metrics (e.g., API response times, error rates, ad campaign sync success rate, daily active users, API-specific error codes).
    *   Collect and store application and system logs in a structured JSON format to enable effective querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights.
    *   CloudWatch Logs will have a defined retention period (e.g., 90 days for active querying, with options for archival to S3 for longer-term storage if required by compliance).
    *   Set alarms for critical thresholds and anomalies, integrated with AWS SNS/SES for notifications to enable proactive issue resolution.
    *   Create custom dashboards for visualizing key metrics.
*   **Distributed Tracing:**
    *   Implement distributed tracing using AWS X-Ray, integrated with NestJS (via AWS X-Ray SDK) and Lambda (Powertools), to facilitate debugging and performance analysis across different services and modules.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Monitoring:**
    *   System KPIs: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network latency, queue lengths (SQS), database connections.
    *   Application KPIs: API error rates (per endpoint), request latency (P95, P99), transaction throughput, database connection pool usage, job execution times.
    *   Business KPIs: Campaign creation success rate, ad sync job completion rates, report generation times, active user sessions, data ingestion rates and errors.
*   **Alerting Policy:**
    *   Define severity levels for alerts (e.g., P1-Critical, P2-High, P3-Medium, P4-Low/Info).
    *   Specify corresponding notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, PagerDuty/OpsGenie for critical alerts) and escalation procedures for each severity level.
    *   Document response time expectations for alerts based on severity.

**5.2 CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
*   **AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy:** Automate the build, test (unit, integration, E2E, security scans), and deployment processes for the Ad Manager backend and frontend.
*   Ensures rapid, reliable, and consistent updates, supporting agile development practices. Securely manage credentials within CI/CD pipelines using AWS Secrets Manager.
*   Git will be used for version control, hosted on AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or GitLab. Branching and merging strategies must be defined.
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Specify deployment strategies (e.g., blue/green, canary, rolling updates) to minimize downtime and risk during updates. Automated rollback procedures must be in place for failed deployments.

**5.3 Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity**

    *   **RTO/RPO:** Adherence to the RTO of [e.g., 4 hours] and RPO of [e.g., 1 hour] defined in NFRs.
    *   **Deployment:** Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment for all critical components (EC2 instances/ALBs, RDS, ElastiCache, ECS/EKS clusters, Fargate services) to ensure high availability.
    *   **Data Backup and Restoration:**
        *   Regular automated backups of databases (RDS snapshots with PITR enabled, DynamoDB continuous backups or on-demand backups) and critical S3 data (with versioning and cross-region replication if RPO/RTO demands).
        *   Backup Frequency and Retention:
            *   RDS PostgreSQL: Automated daily snapshots, transaction log backups for PITR. Snapshot retention for [e.g., 35 days], with monthly snapshots retained for [e.g., 1 year] in S3 Glacier.
            *   DynamoDB: Continuous backups for PITR (if enabled) or daily on-demand backups. Backup retention for [e.g., 35 days].
            *   S3: Versioning enabled for critical buckets. Consider cross-region replication for DR. Lifecycle policies for archival.
        *   Documented and regularly tested restoration procedures for all data stores and application components.
    *   **Failover Strategies:** Strategies for automated or manual failover to a secondary AZ in case of an AZ outage. Cross-region DR strategies will be considered based on business continuity requirements and may involve services like S3 Cross-Region Replication, RDS Cross-Region Read Replicas/Global Database, DynamoDB Global Tables.
    *   **DR Testing:** Regular DR testing (e.g., annually or bi-annually) to validate the plan, procedures, RTO, and RPO. Results and lessons learned must be documented.

**5.4 Additional Services (Email, Notifications)**
*   **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service):** Used for sending transactional emails (e.g., registration, alerts, reports). Monitor bounce and complaint rates. Implement DKIM/SPF/DMARC for deliverability and reputation management.
*   **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):** Manages event notifications for real-time updates. Can integrate with other AWS services (e.g., Lambda) for workflow automation or push notifications to users/systems. Utilize SNS message filtering for targeted delivery.

*   **Patch Management:** A defined process for regular review, testing, and application of security patches and updates to the underlying OS, runtime environments, libraries, and AWS managed services. This includes a vulnerability management program.
*   **Maintenance Windows:** Define procedures for scheduled maintenance, including advance communication to merchants, expected downtime (if any), scope of work, and rollback plans. Aim for minimal disruption, preferably during off-peak hours.

**5.6 Support and Incident Management**
*   **Incident Handling:** A defined process for incident reporting, logging, classification (based on impact and urgency), prioritization, investigation, resolution, and post-mortem analysis (root cause analysis for major incidents).
*   **Support Channels:** Clearly defined support channels for merchants (e.g., helpdesk portal, email, chat, phone support for premium tiers) with defined SLAs for response and resolution times.
*   **Escalation Procedures:** Internal escalation paths for unresolved issues, involving different support tiers and engineering teams.
*   **Knowledge Base:** Development and maintenance of a comprehensive, searchable knowledge base for common issues, FAQs, and resolutions for both support staff and merchants.

**5.7 Auditability**
*   **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive and immutable audit trails must be maintained for:
    *   User access and administrative actions within the Ad Manager (e.g., login attempts (success/failure), role changes, campaign creation/modification/deletion, budget changes, billing information updates, data export).
    *   System-level events (e.g., API calls with parameters, critical configuration changes, data access to sensitive information, automated job executions).
    *   Security events (e.g., authentication failures, authorization denials, WAF blocked requests, detected security anomalies).
*   **Log Integrity and Retention for Audits:** Audit logs must be retained securely for a defined period (e.g., [1-3 years] or as per compliance requirements), protected from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion (e.g., using CloudWatch Logs to S3 with object lock). Logs must be accessible for review by authorized personnel and auditors.
*   **Compliance Reporting:** The system should facilitate the generation of reports required for compliance audits (e.g., user access reports, change management logs, security incident reports).

**5.8 Testability**
*   **Test Environments:** Maintain separate, well-defined environments for development, testing (QA/staging), and production. Test environments should mirror production as closely as possible in terms of configuration, infrastructure, and data (anonymized/masked PII).
*   **Test Data Management:** Procedures for generating, managing, anonymizing/masking, and refreshing test data in non-production environments, ensuring PII is protected and test data is representative.
*   **Automated Testing Integration:** Integration of automated tests (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security vulnerability scans) into the CI/CD pipeline. Test results, including coverage reports, must be logged, reviewed, and act as quality gates for deployment.
*   **Test Plan and Strategy:** A comprehensive test plan and strategy document must be created, outlining testing scope, types of testing, tools, responsibilities, and acceptance criteria.

    *   Security design and controls documentation.
*   **User Documentation:** Comprehensive user manuals, tutorials, FAQs, video guides, and contextual help for merchants, covering all features and workflows. These will serve as a basis for training materials (see 7.3).
*   **Administrative Documentation:** Guides for Platform Administrators on system management, monitoring, user management, billing configuration, and maintenance tasks.
*   **Documentation Updates:** Processes must be in place for keeping all documentation accurate, complete, and up-to-date with system changes and new feature releases. Documentation shall be version-controlled.

**6. Monetization and Billing**
The `[PlatformName]` revenue model for the Ad Manager supports its platform while providing value to merchants:

**6.1 Subscription Fees**
*   Description: Monthly or annual fees charged to merchants for accessing Pro and Plus plans of the Ad Manager.
*   Details: Pricing will vary by tier (Basic, Pro, Plus). The Basic plan may be free with limited features. Pro and Plus plans will offer progressively more advanced tools, higher limits (e.g., number of campaigns, users), and premium features like advanced analytics.
*   Business Rule: Subscription plan upgrades are effective immediately, with prorated charges. Downgrades are effective at the end of the current billing cycle.
*   Business Rule: Failure to pay subscription fees after a defined grace period (e.g., 7 days) may result in suspension of access to Pro/Plus features, reverting to Basic plan functionality or account suspension as per `[PlatformName]` policy.
*   Relevance to Advertising: Higher-tier plans unlock advanced marketing and advertising tools, encouraging merchants to invest more as their advertising needs grow.

**6.2 Transaction Fees**
*   Description: Fees potentially levied on each sale made through the `[PlatformName]` platform, which may be influenced by the plan tier.
*   Details: Typically a small percentage (e.g., 1-3%) per transaction. This is a common model in e-commerce platforms.
*   Business Rule: Transaction fees are calculated on the final sale price after discounts but before shipping and taxes, unless specified otherwise by `[PlatformName]` policy.
*   Relevance to Advertising: Encourages merchants to drive sales volume, partly through effective advertising, to make the platform profitable and offset any fixed costs.

**6.3 App Commissions**
*   Description: Revenue generated from third-party apps sold or subscribed to via the `[PlatformName]` App Store, some of which may be advertising-related.
*   Details: Third-party app developers may pay a commission (e.g., 20-30%) to `[PlatformName]` on app sales or recurring subscription fees.
*   Business Rule: Commission calculations and payout schedules for third-party app developers will be governed by the `[PlatformName]` App Store Developer Agreement.
*   Relevance to Advertising: Supports the development and availability of specialized ad-related apps, enhancing the platform's overall marketing and advertising capabilities for merchants.

**6.4 Advertising Revenue (Potential)**
*   Description: Potential future income stream from offering ad partnerships or in-platform advertising opportunities.
*   Details: May include options for merchants to purchase promoted listings within the `[PlatformName]` ecosystem or partnerships with ad networks (e.g., Google, Snapchat) for preferred placements or services.
*   Relevance to Advertising: Offers merchants additional, potentially integrated, advertising options directly within the `[PlatformName]` ecosystem.

**7. Transition Requirements**

**7.1 Implementation Approach**
*   The Ad Manager Platform will be deployed using a **Phased Rollout Approach**.
    *   **Phase 1: Pilot Program:** Release to a select group of [e.g., 10-20] representative merchants (mix of small, medium, large; varying technical expertise) for a defined period (e.g., 4-6 weeks). This phase will focus on gathering feedback, identifying usability issues, and validating core functionalities in a real-world setting.
    *   **Phase 2: Staged Rollout:** Gradually expand access to a larger percentage of `[PlatformName]` merchants based on predefined criteria (e.g., merchant tier, region, or voluntary opt-in). Each stage will be monitored for performance, stability, and user feedback.
    *   **Phase 3: General Availability:** Full rollout to all eligible `[PlatformName]` merchants.
*   This approach mitigates risks associated with a "big bang" deployment, allows for iterative improvements, and ensures platform stability before full-scale launch.
*   A detailed project plan with timelines, milestones, and responsibilities for each phase will be developed.

**7.2 Data Migration Strategy (Ad Manager Specific Data)**
*   This section addresses migration of data relevant to the Ad Manager platform itself, distinct from product catalog data migration covered in 3.4.4. This is primarily applicable if merchants are transitioning from an existing ad management solution (internal or third-party) to this Ad Manager.
