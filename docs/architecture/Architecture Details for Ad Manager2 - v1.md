# Architecture Design Specification

# 1. Style
Microservices


---

# 2. Patterns

## 2.1. API Gateway
A single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate backend microservices. Handles concerns like authentication, SSL termination, and rate limiting.

### 2.1.3. Benefits

- Simplified client interaction with a complex backend.
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging.
- Decouples clients from microservice discovery and internal structure.
- Enables protocol translation if needed.

### 2.1.4. Tradeoffs

- Can become a bottleneck if not scaled properly.
- Adds another hop in the request path.
- Potential single point of failure if not made highly available.

### 2.1.5. Applicability

- **Scenarios:**
  
  - Microservice-based architectures.
  - Exposing multiple services through a unified interface.
  - Mobile clients requiring optimized payloads.
  
- **Constraints:**
  
  - Requires careful design and management to avoid becoming overly complex.
  

## 2.2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
System components communicate asynchronously via events. Producers publish events, and consumers subscribe to events they are interested in, promoting loose coupling.

### 2.2.3. Benefits

- Improved scalability and resilience through loose coupling.
- Enhanced responsiveness as services don't wait for synchronous replies.
- Services can evolve independently.
- Facilitates real-time data processing and complex event processing.

### 2.2.4. Tradeoffs

- Increased complexity in debugging and tracing distributed flows.
- Requires robust event infrastructure (message brokers).
- Eventual consistency can be challenging for some use cases.

### 2.2.5. Applicability

- **Scenarios:**
  
  - Asynchronous workflows (e.g., order processing, data synchronization).
  - Systems requiring high scalability and decoupling (e.g., ad performance data ingestion).
  - Integrating disparate systems.
  
- **Constraints:**
  
  - Requires careful design of event schemas and handling idempotency.
  

## 2.3. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
An approach to software development that focuses on modeling the software to match a domain according to input from domain experts. Emphasizes a ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain events.

### 2.3.3. Benefits

- Better alignment of software with business needs.
- Improved communication between technical and domain experts.
- More maintainable and evolvable codebase reflecting the domain complexity.
- Clear boundaries for microservices (bounded contexts).

### 2.3.4. Tradeoffs

- Requires significant investment in understanding the domain.
- Can be challenging to implement correctly.
- May lead to over-engineering if applied to simple domains.

### 2.3.5. Applicability

- **Scenarios:**
  
  - Complex business domains (e.g., advertising campaign management, promotions engine).
  - Systems where business logic is a key differentiator.
  - Microservice architectures where service boundaries need to be well-defined.
  
- **Constraints:**
  
  - Access to domain experts is crucial.
  

## 2.4. Circuit Breaker
Prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail. After a configured number of failures, it 'trips' and subsequent calls are failed immediately or routed to a fallback, preventing resource exhaustion.

### 2.4.3. Benefits

- Improves system resilience by handling failures in dependencies gracefully.
- Prevents cascading failures.
- Allows failing services time to recover.

### 2.4.4. Tradeoffs

- Adds complexity to client-side logic.
- Requires careful tuning of thresholds and timeouts.

### 2.4.5. Applicability

- **Scenarios:**
  
  - Interactions with remote services or dependencies that might be unreliable or have transient failures (e.g., ad network APIs).
  - Microservice architectures where inter-service calls are frequent.
  
- **Constraints:**
  
  - Fallback mechanisms should be thoughtfully designed.
  

## 2.5. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separates read and write operations for a data store. Commands update data, and queries read data, potentially using different data models or even different data stores optimized for each.

### 2.5.3. Benefits

- Allows independent scaling of read and write workloads.
- Optimized data models for queries can improve read performance significantly.
- Can simplify complex domain models on the write side.

### 2.5.4. Tradeoffs

- Increased complexity due to separate models and potential data synchronization.
- Eventual consistency between write and read models if different stores are used.

### 2.5.5. Applicability

- **Scenarios:**
  
  - Systems with high read traffic and different query patterns than write patterns (e.g., analytics and reporting).
  - Complex domains where a single model for reads and writes is cumbersome.
  
- **Constraints:**
  
  - May be overkill for simple CRUD applications.
