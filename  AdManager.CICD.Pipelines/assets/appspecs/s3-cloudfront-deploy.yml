# This file is conceptual and not a standard AWS CodeDeploy AppSpec.yml for S3/CloudFront deployments.
# AWS CodeDeploy does not use an AppSpec file for S3 deployments in the same way it does for EC2/ECS.
# The deployment logic for S3 and CloudFront invalidation is typically implemented within
# an AWS CodeBuild project (defined by a buildspec.yml) or a custom AWS Lambda function
# invoked as an action in an AWS CodePipeline stage.

# The typical deployment process for a static frontend application to S3/CloudFront involves:

# 1. Build Stage:
#    - Compile the frontend application (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, Next.js static export).
#    - Produce static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) in an output directory (e.g., 'build', 'dist').

# 2. Deploy Stage (usually a CodeBuild Action in CodePipeline):
#    - Input: Build artifact from the frontend build stage.
#    - Buildspec Commands within this CodeBuild project:
#      - Synchronize static assets to the target S3 bucket:
#        `aws s3 sync ./<build_output_folder_in_artifact> s3://<TARGET_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/ --delete --acl public-read`
#        (Note: --acl public-read might not be recommended; prefer bucket policies for public access.
#         Adjust ACLs or manage public access via S3 bucket policy and CloudFront Origin Access Identity/Control.)
#
#      - If AWS CloudFront is used as a CDN in front of the S3 bucket:
#        Invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure users receive the latest version of the assets:
#        `aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID> --paths "/*"`
#        (Invalidating "/*" can be costly for high-traffic sites. Consider more specific paths if possible,
#         or rely on cache-busting techniques like versioned filenames generated by the build process.)

# Example Buildspec Snippet for S3 Sync and CloudFront Invalidation (within a CodeBuild project for deployment):
#
# version: 0.2
# phases:
#   build:
#     commands:
#       - echo "Deploying to S3 bucket: ${TARGET_S3_BUCKET_NAME}"
#       - aws s3 sync ./<build_output_folder_in_artifact> s3://${TARGET_S3_BUCKET_NAME}/ --delete
#       - |
#         if [ -n "${CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID}" ]; then
#           echo "Invalidating CloudFront distribution: ${CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID}"
#           aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID} --paths "/*"
#         else
#           echo "No CloudFront Distribution ID provided, skipping invalidation."
#         fi
# env:
#   variables:
#     TARGET_S3_BUCKET_NAME: "<YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME_PLACEHOLDER>" # Should be passed from CDK
#     CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID: "<YOUR_CLOUDFRONT_ID_PLACEHOLDER_OR_EMPTY>" # Should be passed from CDK

# This conceptual file serves as a placeholder to acknowledge the S3/CloudFront deployment pattern
# as described in the Software Design Specification (SDS). The actual implementation will reside
# within the `DeployStage` CDK construct, which will create a CodeBuild project configured
# with the necessary AWS CLI commands for S3 sync and CloudFront invalidation.
