# Creating Advertising Campaigns

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a new advertising campaign within the Ad Manager Platform. Campaigns are the core structure for organizing your advertising efforts, defining budget, schedule, target networks, and associated assets.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a campaign, ensure you have:

*   An active Ad Manager Platform account with appropriate permissions.
*   Connected and configured your desired ad network accounts (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads).
*   Uploaded and processed your Product Catalogs if your campaign will advertise products.
*   Created any Promotions you wish to link to the campaign.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these steps to create a new campaign:

1.  **Navigate to the Campaign Creation Interface:**
    *   From the main dashboard, select "Campaigns" from the left-hand navigation menu.
    *   Click the "+ Create New Campaign" button, typically located at the top right of the Campaigns page.

2.  **Define Campaign Name and Objectives:**
    *   **Campaign Name:** Enter a descriptive name for your campaign (e.g., "Summer Sale 2024 - Google Search").
    *   **Objective:** Select the primary goal for this campaign (e.g., Sales, Leads, Website Traffic, Brand Awareness). This may influence available settings later.

3.  **Select Target Ad Network(s):**
    *   Choose the ad networks where this campaign will run (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram Ads, TikTok).
    *   You can select one or more configured networks. The platform will guide you through network-specific settings if applicable.

4.  **Setting Budget and Schedule:**
    *   **Budget:** Specify the campaign's budget.
        *   *Daily Budget:* Maximum amount to spend per day.
        *   *Lifetime Budget:* Total amount to spend over the campaign's duration.
    *   **Schedule:** Define the campaign's duration.
        *   *Start Date:* The date the campaign will begin.
        *   *End Date:* (Optional) The date the campaign will end. Leaving this blank will run the campaign continuously until paused or the lifetime budget is exhausted.

5.  **Specifying Initial Status:**
    *   Choose the initial status for the campaign upon creation:
        *   `Draft`: Save the campaign without launching it. You can return later to complete setup and activate it.
        *   `Active`: The campaign will start running according to its schedule and budget once saved.
        *   `Paused`: The campaign will be created but will not run until manually activated.

6.  **Associating Product Catalogs (REQ-CMO-005):**
    *   If your campaign promotes products (e.g., Shopping campaigns, Dynamic Product Ads), select the relevant Product Catalog(s).
    *   This links your product data to the ads, enabling dynamic ad generation.

7.  **Linking Promotions (REQ-CMO-013):**
    *   Select any active promotions (e.g., discount codes, BOGO offers) you want to automatically apply or highlight in ads associated with this campaign.
    *   This can improve ad performance and conversion rates.

8.  **Saving the Campaign:**
    *   Review all settings.
    *   Click the "Save Campaign" or "Create Campaign" button.
    *   The platform will validate your input and create the campaign. You may be directed to the campaign's dashboard or to the next step (e.g., Ad Set creation).

## Explanation of Fields and Options

*   **Campaign Name:** A user-defined name for easy identification.
    *   *Best Practice:* Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., `[Objective]_[TargetAudience]_[Network]_[DateRange/Promotion]`).
*   **Objective:** The primary goal of your campaign (e.g., `Sales`, `Leads`, `Website Traffic`). This often dictates available bidding strategies and optimization settings.
*   **Target Ad Network(s):** The advertising platforms where your ads will appear.
*   **Budget (Daily/Lifetime):** The amount of money allocated to the campaign.
*   **Schedule (Start/End Dates):** The timeframe during which the campaign will run.
*   **Initial Status:** The state of the campaign upon creation (`Draft`, `Active`, `Paused`).
*   **Product Catalogs:** Collections of your product data used for product-specific advertising.
*   **Promotions:** Special offers linked to your campaign to incentivize customers.

## Tips for Effective Campaign Setup

*   **Use Clear Naming Conventions:** Make it easy to identify campaigns later.
*   **Align Objectives with Business Goals:** Ensure your campaign objective supports a broader business outcome.
*   **Start with a Realistic Budget:** Monitor performance closely and adjust as needed.
*   **Double-Check Dates:** Ensure your start and end dates are correct.
*   **Utilize Drafts:** Save campaigns as drafts if you need to gather more information or get approvals before launching.
*   **Review Network-Specific Settings:** After initial creation, you may need to configure additional settings for each selected ad network within the Ad Sets or Ads.
