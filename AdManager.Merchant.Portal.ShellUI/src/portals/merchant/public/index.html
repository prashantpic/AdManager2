      Note for Next.js: 
      This public/index.html file is generally not the primary HTML shell for a Next.js application.
      Next.js uses `src/pages/_document.tsx` to customize the <html> and <body> tags and overall document structure.
      This file would only be served if a user directly navigates to /index.html.
      The main application entry point is managed by Next.js routing through the `pages` directory.

            In a standard React app (not Next.js with `pages` router), this div#root would be the mount point.
